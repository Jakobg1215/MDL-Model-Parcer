# A MDL File Parser

This is a project to understand the source 1 model format.

It inclues files MDL, ANI, PHY, VTX and VVD.

# Goals

As of right now it only reads model version 48 but want to support other versions.

All the parsers will have no unread bytes and everything will be documented of the format.

Make a better readme.
